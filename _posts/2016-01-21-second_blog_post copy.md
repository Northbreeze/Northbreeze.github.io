title: Application of k-means clustering algorit!
---


**My Thesis**

As part of my M.Sc. in Management Engineering from the University of Waterloo, I wrote a thesis on [“Detecting Weak Signals by Internet-Based Environmental Scanning.”](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/6314/Tabatabaei_Nasim.pdf?sequence=1) This was an opportunity to apply data mining, computer tools and human judgement to predict the market potential of a new product called Micro-tile which is displayed below.

I used both programming and human analysis to retrieve 40,000 HTML pages, analyze the data, and produce information that was relevant for the strategic marketing department of Christie Digital. 

To succeed in my thesis, I used a novel methodology which enabled me to consolidate data from a large sample of web pages and convert it into practicable information. I retrieved 40,000 HTML pages to extract weak signals and find behavior patterns. It was essential to cluster pages according to their content. I chose to use a combination of Apple script (in the pre-processing phase to convert from HTLM to txt); the k-means algorithm (with each cluster accounting for no more than 10% of the overall count) and CLUTO for the clustering function. This enabled me to produce clusters with similar content (matching key words), which were ready for human analysis.

In this post, I would specifically want to discuss the k-mean clustering algorithm.
