title: Application of K-means Clustering Algorithm in Society!

As part of my M.Sc. in Management Engineering from the University of Waterloo, I wrote a thesis on [“Detecting Weak Signals by Internet-Based Environmental Scanning.”](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/6314/Tabatabaei_Nasim.pdf?sequence=1) This was an opportunity to apply data mining, computer tools and human judgement to predict the market potential of a new product called Micro-tile which is displayed below.

I used both programming and human analysis to retrieve 40,000 HTML pages, analyze the data, and produce information that was relevant for the strategic marketing department of Christie Digital. 

To succeed in my thesis, it was essential to cluster pages according to their content. I chose k-means algorithm (with each cluster accounting for no more than 10% of the overall count) and [CLUTO](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/cluto/cluto/overview) for the clustering function. This enabled me to produce clusters with similar content (matching key words), which were ready for human analysis. I think this method is really useful in text minign and web mining area, that's why in this post I intend to talk about k-means clustering algorithm in R and provide an example.

### Clustering

Clustering algorithm is one of the most influential and fastest method in machine learning. It is used to group large amounts of data into a number of clusters. Clustering is part of the unsupervised method which means that no training set is required. In this post, I would specifically want to discuss the K Means clustering algorithm and provide an example to undrestand how it works in R.


### K Means Algorithm

Below are the steps to perform K-means algorithm:


1- Select K as the initial number of clusters

2- Data set should be separated in to k clusters randomly

3- Compute distances between each of cluster means and all other points

4- Assign all points to the closest centroid and move data points if they are not close to their own clusters

5- Recompute the centroid of each cluster
  
6- Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the K clusters are reached and when the assignment of the documents to cluster no longer changes.

To learn more about kmeans clustering, look at this video.

### kmeans in R

I want to show a quick demo of applying this method in R. R has a function called `k-means` that can be used for k clustering.  

I would like to use Lawyers' ratings of state judges in the US Superior Court to analyze kmeans clustering. To find out more about the variables in this dataset, take a look at this [link](Lawyers' ratings of state judges in the US Superior Court).

```{r}
# load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# reading csv file
USJudgeRatings <- read.csv("USJudgeRatings.csv")
```

```{r}
# removing N/A 
US_Judge <- na.omit(USJudgeRatings)

# use str function to see the structure of the data
str(US_Judge)
US_Judge_df <- data.matrix (US_Judge)

```

I used pairs function to see scatter plots matrices for the data set to get the feeling of how dataset looks like. You can read further [here](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/pairs.html) as it was my reference.

```{r}
panel.hist <- function(x, ...)
{
    usr <- par("usr"); on.exit(par(usr))
    par(usr = c(usr[1:2], 0, 1.5) )
    h <- hist(x, plot = FALSE)
    breaks <- h$breaks; nB <- length(breaks)
    y <- h$counts; y <- y/max(y)
    rect(breaks[-nB], 0, breaks[-1], y, col = "cyan", ...)
}


pairs(USJudgeRatings[2:4], panel = panel.smooth,
      cex = 2, pch = 25, bg = "light green",
      diag.panel = panel.hist, cex.labels = 2, font.labels = 2)
```

Now we assume, the number of clusters can be 4. As mentioned above, the number of clusters will be chosen  randomly, I use Kmeans() function in R. I put nstart as 30 here, it has been mentioned that nstart parameter can be any number between 20 and 50 which means that R will "try 30 different random starting assignments and then select the one with the lowest within cluster variation". [source](https://datascienceplus.com/k-means-clustering-in-r/)

```{r}
# using kmeans clustering algorithm
cluster_4 <- kmeans(US_Judge_df, 4, nstart = 20)

# print cluster
cluster_4
```
We can see the structure of the clusters by using the following function.

```{r}

# structre of the clusters
str(cluster_4)
```

**Evaludate clusters**

betweenss and withinss are the measures for sum of squares. A good clustering algorithm, should have lower value of withinss and higher value of betweenss. Since we randomly chose k as 4 in the initial clustering algorithm, we don't know if k is a good value or not. We can prepare a chart which shows the number of clusters vs whitin groups sum of squares. The minimum value of k is the best value for clustering. You can refer to this [link](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/33876_1d7794d9a86647ca90c4f182df93f0e8.html) to determine the proper way to find the optimum value of k by having a chart.


```{r}
#cluster centers
cluster_4$centers
```

Now, we are plotting the clusters.

```{r}
# plotting clusters

plot(US_Judge_df , col =(cluster_4$cluster +1) , main="K-Means Result with 4 Clusters", pch=20, cex=2)
```

**Final Note**

Please note that, the intention of this post was to get familiar with R codes for getting kmeans cluster and understand the algorithm conceptually. I'll write another post to analyze clusters for judge data set.
