My name is Nasim. I'm currently studying master of Data science at UBC. I've bachelor of Industrial engineering and master of Management Sciences from University of Waterloo. I worked 4 years in Deloitte consulting in toronto and vancouver. As a consultant, I saw how data analytics can help in solving marketing and customer relationship issues. Previous to that, in my masterâ€™s work, I learned about the theoretical frameworks for using data analytics to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.

I am hoping to fine-tune my data analytics skills, and use them to explore psychological and sociological phenomena. I believe that the intersection of Big Data and group behavior will yield crucially important insight in the next decades, and I want to be part of this change.
